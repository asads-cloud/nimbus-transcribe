The Life of Muhammad (ﷺ), The Meccan Period

Alhamdulillah was-salatu was-salamu ‘ala Sayyidina Muhammad wa ‘ala alihi wa sahbihi wa sallam.

Yesterday we talked about the importance of studying seerah, and now we'll start with the first session itself.  
Usually, the scholars who write about the life of Muhammad ﷺ do not begin directly with his birth, but go back further — to his father Ibrahim (عليه السلام).  

They emphasize the lineage of Hajar and Ismail rather than Ishaq and Sara, because that is the line of Muhammad ﷺ.  
Ibrahim (عليه السلام) brought Hajar and his son Ismail to the valley of Makkah. He left them with some water and dates, then turned away.  

Hajar ran after him and asked, “Are you going to leave us in a place where no one lives?”  
Ibrahim (عليه السلام) did not reply until she asked, “Allah amarak bihada? — Did Allah command you to do this?”  
He said: “Yes.”  

She replied with full trust: *“Then Allah will not neglect us (فَلَن يُضَيِّعَنَا اللّٰه).”*  

Look at the faith of this woman: in the middle of the desert, with no food, no water — but absolute certainty that Allah will provide.
